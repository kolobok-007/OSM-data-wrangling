# Wrangling OpenStreetMap Data 
OSM_data_wrangling.py:
Wrangles, parses, and cleanes OSM data and transforms it to JSON format that is loaded into a MongoDB database.

data_analysis.py:
Data processing pipelines that query data from a MongoDB database to answer specific questions about the dataset.

waterloo-region_canada.bz2:
I've used waterloo-regioin data but any OSM data should work. Also note the data is archieved to save space. Extract it locally to use it.
